## How to Capture Screenshots

1. **macOS**: `Cmd + Shift + 4` to select area, or `Cmd + Shift + 5` for options
2. Save screenshots with descriptive names (e.g., `study-plan-creation.png`)
3. Place in the corresponding subfolder
4. Recommended format: PNG for clarity

## Naming Convention

Use lowercase with hyphens: `feature-description.png`

Examples:
- `chat/course-list-response.png`
- `google-calendar/study-plan-events.png`
- `notion/study-notes-page.png`
- `academic-integrity/homework-refusal.png`
